# Advanced CircleCI Configuration

This repository contains course materials and reference assets for **CircleCI Advanced Configuration**, a 90-minute intermediate course by Tim Warner. It focuses on orchestrating complex multi-stage workflows, promoting configuration reuse through parameters and commands, and integrating certified CircleCI orbs to deliver reliable CI/CD pipelines at scale. The scenarios build on Globomantics robotics applications to demonstrate real-world patterns for sequencing jobs, fanning out and in, and deploying to cloud services.

## Topics
- CircleCI advanced pipelines
- Workflow orchestration (fan-out/fan-in, sequential dependencies, approvals)
- Pipeline parameters, commands, executors, and configuration reuse
- CircleCI orbs for notifications and cloud deployments
- CI/CD best practices for DevOps and platform engineering teams
- Globomantics sample applications and deployment patterns
